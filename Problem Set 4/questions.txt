0.  BMP: 4 billion, GIF: 256, JPEG: 16 million, PNG: 16 million.
1.  GIF
2.  Lossy compression reduces file size by removing some infomation, while lossless uses a reversable algorithim to compress.
3.  JPEG
4.  The address to the file is deleted, but the actual file still remains on the hard drive
5.  Delete files with the secure delete option, which fills all of the data with 0s.
6.  It is a header file that declares integer types' specified widths.
7.  For specific number usage.
8.  BYTE is 1 byte, DWORD is 4 bytes, LONG is 4 bytes, WORD is 2 bytes
9.  The first two bytes of a BMP is a WORD and denotes bfType, which specifies the file type. It must be
 	set to the signature word BM (0x4D42) to indicate bitmap.
10. bfSize specifies the size, in bytes, of the bitmap file while biSize specifies the size of the structure in bytes.
11. If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down device-independent bitmap and its origin is the upper left corner.
12. The biBitCount member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure determines the number of bits that define each pixel and 
    the maximum number of colors in the bitmap.
13. Not enough disk space, no authoritation to create outfile.
14. Since there will be only 1 BITMAPINFOHEADER inside a bmp, the fread should only read 1 set of sizeof(BITMAPFILEHEADER).
15. 1
16. The fseek() function sets the file position indicator for the inptr pointed to by inptr. 
17. This is an integer constant which, when used as the whence argument to the fseek or fseeko function,
	specifies that the offset provided is relative to the current file position
